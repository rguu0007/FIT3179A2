              <p>The map reveals a global trend of decreasing fertility rates over time. In the 1960s, fertility rates
                worldwide were notably higher than in subsequent decades. Specifically, Rwanda held the record with the
                highest fertility rate of 8.19 during that period. However, by 2020, Niger claimed the highest fertility
                rate, reaching 6.74. Then, let's compare the fertility rate of each country by time.

              <p>The view of the chart for the year 1960 reveals intriguing insights into the fertility rates across

              <p>GDP is often considered a significant factor believed to impact fertility rates. However, upon

              <p>The patterns emerging from the data indicate that high GDP countries do not necessarily exhibit high
